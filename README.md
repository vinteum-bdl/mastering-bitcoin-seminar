# Mastering Bitcoin Seminar

Welcome to the Masterng Bitcoin Seminar promoted by Vinteum. This is a 6-week
seminar in which we dive deep into the foundational concepts of
the Bitcoin protocol as covered in the book [Mastering
Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) by Andreas Antonopoulos and
David Harding. This cohort is designed for anyone looking to gain a thorough
understanding of Bitcoin as preparation to the [Bitcoin Dev Launchpad by Vinteum
Program](https://github.com/vinteum-bdl). 

## Who should join?

- Developers looking to build applications on top of Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin enthusiasts wanting to understand the inner workings of the Bitcoin
  protocol and network.
- Investors and financial professionals seeking a deeper understanding of
  Bitcoin technology.
- Students and researchers interested in blockchain and cryptocurrency
  technologies.

Keep in mind that this is a technical seminar. A computer science background
will be helpful, but it is not strictly necessary to fruitfully participate in
the discussions. Anyone interested in understanding the technical
aspects of the Bitcoin protocol and its broader implications in finance and
technology is welcome.

## Seminar Format

The seminar is designed for oriented self-study. Each week, participants are
assigned a reading goal and a pool of motivating questions. Participants are
expected to study the material, prepare answers to their questions, and actively
participate in the weekly discussion sessions.

The weekly sessions are socratic seminars, not lectures. The Socratic seminar is
a formal discussion, based on a text, in which the leader asks open-ended
questions. Within the context of the discussion, participants listen closely to
the comments of others, thinking critically for themselves, and articulate their
own thoughts and responses to the thoughts of others. They learn to work
cooperatively and to question intelligently and civilly.

The main discussions happen at the weekly meetings, but the [Discord
channel](https://discord.gg/N5RAvC8Zqk) will also be available for inquiries and
discussions between peers.
